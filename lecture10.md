## Lecture 10
I missed this lecture sadly, but here is a summary of the slides
### UML and Architecture
#### Design in the Large
* Architecture
* Architectural Patterns
* Sources
    * Bennett, McRobb & Farmer, O-O Systems Analysis & Design, Chapter 13 *System Design and Architecture*
    * Larman, Applying UML and Patterns, Chapter 13 *Logical Architectures and UML Package Diagrams* (+ Ch 17 & Ch 39).
    * Sommerville, Software Engineering, Chapter 6 *Architectural Design*

#### Thing Big, Act Small, Fail Fast, Learn Rapidly
* Slogan from Lean Software Development (another Agile method)
    * Has the principle of *See the whole* amongst others
    * != do the whole design early!
* The remainder of the course is about seeing the whole when building  single system
* This is architectural thinking
    * It is the translation from the **problem domain** to the **solution concepts**
        * Technology with purpose
### Architecture Definition
#### Architecture
* Software architecture
    * The set of principal design decisions about the system
    * The heart software system
* Well-engineered software
    * Good software architecture
    * Good set of design decisions
* NB - This is very different from the other meaning of architecture in CS - hardware and associated abstractions
#### Definition
* Basic idea: it is about the **big** picture; the large scale
    * Motivations
    * Constraints
    * Organizations
    * Patterns
    * Responsibilities
> An architecture is the set of significant decisions about the organization of a software system, the selection of the structural elements and their interfaces by which the system is composed, together with their behaviour as specified in the collaborations among those elements, the composition of these structural and behavioural elements into progressively larger subsystems, and the architectural style that guides this organizationâ€”these elements and their interfaces, their collaborations, and their composition - Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson, *The UML User Guide*, 1999
