# CSC3003S ASD Notes 
Advanced Software Development (ASD) notes made for the course CSC3003S at UCT.

This is a collection of notes I have made for my third year computer science course at the University of Cape Town. I generally summarized the slides, and added content that I deemed valuable or interesting. Hence, these notes were taken & adapted from slides and lectures created by the following people:
* [Edwin Blake](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~edwin/)
* [Melissa Densmore](http://ict4d.cs.uct.ac.za/user/10)
* [JonJon Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-clark-637344143/)
* Gary Stewart
