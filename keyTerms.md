# Key Terms
Here are some basic definitions and abbreviations that are useful for studying.


## Definitions


**Software Engineering** - The Application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

**Milestone** - Checkpoints throughout the life of a project. Identify when one or multiple groups of activities have been completed thus implying that a notable point has been reached in the project.

**Deliverable** - Measurable and tangible outcome of the project. Developed by project team members in alignment with the goals of the project.

**Gold-plating** - adding shiny new features that aren't necessary 

**Scope Creep** - uncontrolled growth in scope after project begins

**Crunch** - Extended working hours

**Software Entropy** - Measure of code complexity

**Yak Shaving** - Endless series of small tasks before next big milestone

**Artefacts** - (belong in a museum) byproduct of the development process

**Timescale** - the time allowed for or taken by a process/task

**User Stories** - stories describing each requirement - like use cases but lighter

**Refactoring** - change internal code structure so it is easier to understand and cheaper to change, without modifying behaviour of program

**Software Architecture** - set of principal design decisions about software systems

**Architecture Description** - artefacts to express and document architectures.

**High Cohesion** - degree of intra-class communication

**Low Coupling** - degree of inter-class communication

**Domain Specific Software Architecture (DSSA)** - idea that for any given business, there will be existing architectures relevant to that business's domain which can be used to build an architecture tailored for that business


**Vertical architecture** - layered, each layer uses previous layer, each layer has its own function

**Horizontal architecture** - multi-tiered, can have aspects of application layer across all layers/tiers
