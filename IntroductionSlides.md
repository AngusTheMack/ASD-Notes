# What is version/source control?
* Version control systems are a category of software tools that
help a software team manage changes to source code over
time.
* keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind
of database
* If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and
compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake
while minimizing disruption to all team members
## source Control
Managing a codebase with lots of simultaneous contributors

| Distributed| Centralized|
| --- | --- |
| Mercurial (hg),git | CVS, Subversion|
| Work in local repository, sync changes later | Repository exists on a client server, work on clients |
