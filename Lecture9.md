## Lecture 9
### Demos and Prototypes
#### What is a Software Prototype?
* It depends
* Helps to investigate
    * Technical issues
    * Work flow, task design
    * Screen layouts, information display
    * Difficult, controversial critical areas
    * Match between
#### Why Prototype?
* Enable evaluation and feedback (central to design methodology)
* Improves communication with a team
* Testing ideas out - encourages reflection
* Answer questions!
* Explore alternatives 
#### Prototype Requires Compromises
* Slwo respone, sketchy icons, fake data, limited functionality, limited parameters
* Horizontal Prototype
    * Wide range of functions, very litte detail on each e.g.: testing user interface before backend is developed
* Vertical Prototype
    * Provide a lot of detail
#### Throw-Away Prototype
* Address high-risk issues
    * Uncertainty in requirements
    * User interface design
    * Alternative implementation strategies
    * Technology platform
* Only enough effort
#### Evolutionary Prototypes
* Intended to be early, not necessarily release-able version of the actual software ... will evolve into the final product
* Quality is important (unit test are back)
* Can be put to limited use

### The Demo

#### How to Beat Murphy!
1. Make sure your system works
2. Make sure your system works
3. Also, practice and rehearse the demo
#### How to make sure the system works
* No last minute code changes
* Demo stable version with fewer features rather than an untested version with more
* Rehearse the entire demo
* No, really resist the temptation to tweak the demo
* Test any peripherals
#### Preparing for the Demo
* List (and test) the tasks you will demonstrate
* Plan what to say
    * Very short overview of the system
    * Explain what the demo will show
* Plan what to say during each test, work out the steps involved
* Ensure that each team member participants and can demonstrate contribution to knowledge
* Rehearse and time the demo
* Think of
#### Before the demo
* Arrive Early
* Make sure the system works
#### During the Demo
* Be prepared to change direction in response to questions
* Allow and encourage the client to try things (if you are prepared for this and it is safe)
* Be prepared to show code or data or documentation
* Be prepared to answer questions
#### Something Bad Happens
* Stay calm
* Don't make effusive apologies if anything goes wrong
    * Fix the problems quitely
    * Be able to restart the
