# Open Source Software Development
# Open Source Development
* An approach to software in which the source code of a software system is published
    * Volunteers participate in the development
# Open Source Software
* Operating Systems
# Interesting Facts
* Apache, which is open source, is the most popular web server in the world
* Much of the software used to run the internet, is open source
* Most popular alternative to Microsoft Office, **LibreOffice/OpenOffice**, is open source
* Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers are open source
* SQLite, file-based open source database, deployed with Android and Apple devices, Mozilla Firefox
* MySQL, open source database is used in critical application by Google
# Open Source and Business
* Software companies responds to Open Source differently:
    * Some use it extensively to build their business
        * Thawte - consulting of Mark Shuttleworth (??)
    * Some enthusiastically open source much of their software
        * Google with android
    * Some initially vehemently opposed Open Source, open source some of their software
        * Microsoft with VS code
    * Some have released free versions of their software to counteract influence of Open Source
        * Microsoft with Visual Studio
    * Some promote Open source offerings
        * IBM and HP promote Linux
    * Some have Open Source business models
        * MySQL
# Open Source Business Models
* Although open source software is freely distributed many companies are able to run viable businesses with it, e.g.:
    * Dual licensing, with free entry level version, and upgraded high level version having a cost
    * Service contracts featuring support and updates
    * Paid for training and learning materials
    * Developing customised extensions
* Open sourcing a product allows it to be developed
    * Quickly
    * Cheaply
    * Robustly
* Having this large user base allows your code to be scrutinized by multiple people
# Open Source Development Culture
* A community volunteers, so do need to get the culture and motivating forces right
> People should feel that their connection to a project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to their contributions
* A shared culture and etiquette for participation exists
* Be aware of the issues and politics
    * *Open Source* vs *Free Software*
* Build trust and social capital and slowly establish merit by offering solutions and for various issues
* Bossy, critical people won't be welcome
    * Everyone needs to feel welcome
# Open Source Development Culture
* FLOSS developers are proud of their achievements and continuously work to improve their software
    * Tend to treat their projects as their babies: very protective
* Essentially an exercise in Computer Supported Cooperative Work
    * Contributing are distributed and may never meet
# Open Source Issues
* Most free software projects fail: approximately 90-95%
* Structural issues
    * Unrealistic or vague specifications
    * Insufficient design
* Unrealistic expectations
    * Too few active developers
    * Open code has to be made comprehensible to strangers
    * Needs suitable tools, development web, communication tools
* Barriers to entry for new developers and new users
    * Poor presentation, documentation and packaging
* Challenges in project management
    * In-house management practices don't work
# Onion Model of OS Community Structure
* Core team has developer(s) who make decisions about software's direction, contributions to code base
* Committers have commit rights that allow admission to main code base
* Active developers regularly contribute to the code base
* Peripheral developers submit code as patches i.e. code does not enter code base until review from core team
* Active users contribute documentation, localization, support users in discussion forums, or file bug reports
* Passive users download and use the software without connecting to the community
# Ways of running FOSS projects
* Benevolent Dictators (BDFLs)
    * Linux and Linus Torvalds
    * Python and Guido van Rossum
    * Potential for forks means there are no true dictators
* Consensus-based Democracy
    * e.g.: apache
* Business-drive
    * e.g.: MySQL
# Before you start a FOSS project, first look
* Check whether someone else has done what you intend
* If they did, and open sourced their code, there is no reason to reinvent the wheel
    * There is no point not looking, and the payoff can beb huge
* Try internet search engines, or FOSS repositories
    * freshmeat.sourceforge.net (no longer updated)
    * www.sourceforge.net
    * directory.fsf.org - Free Software Foundation's directory
# What a FOSS Project needs
* Web Site
    * One-way information form the project out to the public
    * Interface for other project tools
* Mailing list
    * Usually most active communications forum in the project
    * "medium of record"
* Real-time chat
    * Quick, lightweight discussions; question/answer exchanges
* Version control
    * Enables developers to manage code changes conveniently
    * Enables everyone to watch what's happening to the code
* Bug tracking
    * Enables developers to keep track of what they're working on, coordinate with each other, and plan releases
# Making your Vision Public
* Choose a Good Name
    * Check against existing name & trademarks
* Register the domain (even if you use a canned host)
    * Canned hosting: site that offers free hosting and infrastructure for open source projects
        * web area
        * version control
        * bug tracker
        * download area
        * chat forums
        * regular backups
* Set up the website

# Features, Requirements and Status
* Features
    * Answers "What does it do?"
    * Brief list of the features the software supports
        * Put "planned" or "in progress" where that is so
* Requirements
    * Computing environment required to run the software
* Now people can decide if this software can work for them
    * And they can consider getting involved as developers
* Development Status
    * List the project's near-term goals and needs
        * e.g.: looking for developer with particular expertise
    * History of past releases, with features lists
        * Gives and idea of progress and speed
# Distribution
* Downloads
    * Source code in standard formats
    * Executables can come later
* The distribution mechanism should be as convenient, standard, and low-overhead as possible
* Important to standardize build and installation procedures
    * Otherwise you discourage developers who might otherwise have contribute to the code
# Version Control
* Allows you to safely store successive versions of your source code
    * Secure backup copy of the source code
    * Back-track to a stable version if things go horribly wrong
* Help to identify particular versions (or revisions) of your project, such as a particular product release
* Make it possible to create a new branch of your application source code, and work on this branch without compromising the stability of the original version
# Accurate Accounting of Deficiencies
* Documenting deficiencies out in the open, is the norm in the open source world
* Identify issues scrupulously and dispassionately in context
    * In the documentation
    * In the bug tracking database
    * On a mailing list discussion
* People will discover the deficiencies anyway
    * It's much better for them to be psychologically prepared that there are bugs
    * Shows a solid knowledge of how things are going
# Bug Tracking
* Bug Tracking software is useful to developers
* Signifies that a project should be taken seriously
    * Bugs are responded to promptly
    * Duplicate bugs are unified
* The higher the number of bugs in the database, the better the project looks!
    * Number of bugs recorded really depends on three things:
        1. Absolute number of bugs present in the software
        2. Number of users using the software
        3. Convenience with which those users can register new bugs
    1. Of these, 2 & 3 are more significant than 1
# Issue Life Cycle

![Issue Tracking](img/issuetracking.png)

# Documentation Minimal Criteria
* Tell the reader what expertise they need to have
* Describe clearly and thoroughly how to set up the software
* Give on tutorial-style example for every common task
* Label areas where the documentation is known to be incomplete
* Typically a real world user expects to install and use the software with no or minimal review of documentation
    * Searchable documentation should

# Licensing
* MIT - can use in closed environment

# Open Source Impact on Society
* Undermines the idea that work should be done for economic/financial gain
* Challenges traditional notions of copyright and intellectual property, which restricts others from modifying "creative" work
* Open Source software is used extensively in ICT for Development (ICT4D)
    * No or little cost, as compared to proprietary software
