# Project Management
## Planning
* Project Scope
    * Defining scope
        * Narrative: narrative description of software based on what stakeholders say
        * Use cases: stories describing user interaction with software, from user POV
    * Determine feasibility
        * Given the scope, determine the resources required
    * Project Planning Goals
        * AKA Scope
        * Create measurable goals
            * S - Specific
            * M - Measurable
            * A - Agreed upon
            * R - Realistic
            * T - Time boxed
    * Deliverables
    * Schedule
    * Supporting Plans
        * HR Plan
        * Communication & Management Plan
        * Risk Management Plan
        * Marketing Plan

* Management Activities
    * People
        * Managers, PM, Team Leads, Customers, End-users
    * Product
        * Scope/Decomposition
    * Process
        * SDLC
            * Initiation -> Analysis -> Design -> Construct -> Test -> Implement
        * UP
            * Inception -> Elaboration -> Construction -> Transition -> Production
    * Project
        * Size estimation, scheduling, risk management, tracking
* People
    * Roles and Responsibilities
        * Project Management
        * Systems Analysis
        * User Interface Designer
        * Architect
            * Middleware
        * Specialists
        * Documentation
    * Essential Roles
        * Course Developer
        * Database Designer
        * Implementer
        * Integrator
        * Process Engineer
        * Project Manager
        * Project Reviewer
        * Software Architect
        * Systems Administrator
        * Systems Analyst
        * System Tester
        * Test Manager
        * UI Designer
    * Management and Team Success
        * Software Engineering is a group activity
        * Individual success depends:
            * Ability and interest to work hard etc
        * Team success depends on:
            * Ability to communicate and express ideas in the team
            * Group interaction is a key determinant of group performance
        * Management Skills

* Estimation and Metrics
    * Milestones and Deliverables
        * Activity - Task that takes time
            * Duration
            * Due date
            * Precursor
        * Milestone
            * Completion of an activity
            * Recognizable end-product of a task
            * Requires a formal output
        * Deliverable
            * A project result that is delivered to a customer
        * Milestone vs deliverable
            * Deliverable is a measurable and tangible outcome of the project. They are developed by project team members in alignment with the goals of the project
            * Milestones on the other hand are checkpoints throughout the life of the project. They identify when one or multiple groups of activities have been completed thus implying that a notable point has been reached in the project
    * Software Metric Characteristics
        * Process Metrics
            * Some aspect of the development process
        * Product Metrics
            * Some aspect of the software product
        * Result Metrics
            * Measure outcomes
        * Predictor Metrics
            * quantify estimates for project resource requirements
    * Are they worth anything?
        * Yes
        * Useful for prediction
        * Size metrics used for resource requirements
## Scheduling
* Split the work in a project into separate tasks
* Network Analysis
    * Label tasks in order and indicate dependencies
    * Fill in earliest start, earliest finish
    * Fill in latest start, latest finish
    * Fill in total float
    * Fill in free float
* Gantt Charts
## Risks
* 3M's
    * Mitigation
    * Monitoring
    * Management
* Risk Matrix
    * Probability
    * Impact
## Planning vs Management
* Planning
    * Pre/Post
    * Network analysis, resourcing
* Management
    * During
    * Controlling resources and timescales
